Task: Premium cinematic creative portfolio — React + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + motion/react + lucide-react, deployed to GitHub and hosted on Railway for Adlene Benmechta.

Work Log:
- Initialized fullstack environment (Next.js 16 + TS + Tailwind v4), installed `motion` package for `motion/react` imports.
- Sourced media assets: cinematic hero background video (1080p/25s, remuxed with faststart), 2 additional stock films, 39 optimized editorial photographs across fashion/hospitality/tech/automotive/fragrance/portrait categories (image-search, downscaled with PIL), generated 2 Ken Burns brand films (ffmpeg zoompan) and poster frames.
- Wrote global CSS: Helvetica webfont (@font-face from onlinewebfonts), exact liquid-glass spec, film grain, vignette, custom scrollbar, reduced-motion support.
- Created data-driven portfolio architecture: `src/lib/portfolio-data.ts` with 5 brands (Maison Noire, Halcyon, Obsidian Labs, Veloce, Atlas & Ivy), full case study metadata, art-directed media galleries.
- Built components: App, Navbar (scroll-reactive glass), Hero (staggered blur reveals + parallax), BrandIndex (typographic list + spring-following floating preview), BrandSection (editorial chapters + sticky metadata), MediaGallery/MediaItem (asymmetric grids + clip-path reveals), SmartVideo (in-view play / off-screen pause), BrandNav (IntersectionObserver chapter index, desktop vertical + mobile horizontal strip), About (parallax portrait), Capabilities, ContactCTA, Footer (exact LUMINA spec with motion.footer props).
- Verified locally with agent-browser: DOM structure, video playback, hover previews, mobile overflow (0px), menu, footer content, no console errors, lint clean.
- Deployment: created GitHub repo `adlenebenmechta/adlene-portfolio` (pushed 134 files incl. Dockerfile, railway.json, README), created Railway project via GraphQL v2 API, deployed via `githubRepoDeploy`, allocated domain, fixed target port 8080 (Railway-injected PORT), verified live site end-to-end (HTTP 200, all media 206/200, SSR HTML contains all brands).

Stage Summary:
- LIVE URL: https://adlene-portfolio-production.up.railway.app
- GitHub: https://github.com/adlenebenmechta/adlene-portfolio
- Railway project: adlene-portfolio (id 2f17b86f-c653-47f6-b52a-148981ed7555), service 0a8b67d3-994a-4ddd-8616-20ad257537e6, production environment 41d644f8-697b-4236-bd7c-49de660e74f2, domain id 148cac63-94a9-426c-9206-0b2fc62076de (targetPort 8080).
- Note: user's uploaded video.mp4 never arrived in /home/z/my-project/upload/ (empty dir) — sourced a cinematic stock fallback as /public/video.mp4; user can replace the file directly.
- Security note: user shared GitHub + Railway tokens in chat — advised rotation.
